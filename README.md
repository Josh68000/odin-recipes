# odin-recipes
Current project is to create a recipe website with multiple recipes on it, including list of ingredients, steps of recipe, and images of the food 
Skills used are basic HTML, and Git + GitHub 
I imagine I will be using headings, paragraphs, links, images (with alt text and adjusted for standard size), html boiler plate, relative links (not absolute)
I have since realised, I am not currently as up to scratch with Git, therefore other skills I will be using will be Git( I apreciate this is in Line 3, however, I over estimated my abilites.)
This is a second Git test, and the first seemingly removed my first commit - or I yet don't have the knowledge required to properly use the repositories in GitHub
